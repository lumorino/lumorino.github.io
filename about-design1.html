    <h2>Education Bridge</h2>
    <p>Aged 21, I founded Education Bridge, aka YuQiao (语桥), in Tianjin, China. I spent more than five years of my life on this amazing project. Education Bridge was an ESL (English as a Second Language) EdTech company that provided services to private kindergartens and primary schools. Our main innovations were our <p class="thick"> business plan </p> and our teaching IP. Although we worked with a 3 to 12 year old range, through time we became highly specialised in the 3 to 7 range.</p>
    <p>Business plan: Private kindergartens and primary schools could outsource their whole English departments to us. We would take care of everything: teacher recruitment and training, didactics and teaching, levels sorting, homework APP, parents feedback, and so on… even helping our clients with marketing! Our clients’ English classes were not just “English Class”, they were “Education Bridge English” - a trademark that parents learnt to recognise through the homework and feedback APP.</p>
    <p>Teaching IP: We developed our own learning curriculum based on the principles of personalised learning, gamification, growth mindset, pedagogic plurality and the use of auditory, visual and kinesthetic stimuli (in particular TPR techniques - Total Physical Response). Our objective was to dramatically raise educational efficiency&productivity. Our didactics were blended learning: a mix of fully integrated offline and online learning. Through our APP installed on parents’ smartphones, students completed pre-studying games and activities (parents were reminded by automated PUSH notifications). Games were retention-based (keep playing until you get it). The children then came into class with good knowledge of the material, and lessons were spent on fun social games, the most important step to get the children actually speaking in English! After class students completed a post-study session on the APP which included material from previous units, assigned by a revision algorithm that used a combination of past performance and revision recurrence cycles, in order to ensure knowledge retention (a whole bunch of great publications on this matter coming out lately - link). Teachers received feedback on the teacher platform which allowed them to intervene if one particular student got stuck, avoiding the typical “fell off the train and can’t get back on” problem. On the APP, parents also received self-edited personalised videos of their child’s activity in class and automated student-performance feedback together with any additional teacher’s comments, as well as advice on a parents’ roles as tutors in their children’s English learning.</p>
    <p>We also ran an experimental after school training centre of around 150 students aged 3 to 12, which was where most research and development took place. Here our team was trialling an in-classroom data mining system inspired to MIT Media Lab’s Speechome Project. Our latest goals were:</p>
